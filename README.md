## Disclaimer

The "test" is written as per requirements of the provided [PDF](Bowling%20Assignment%20-%20Front%20End%20Developer.pdf).  
However, the assignment had Javascript as a requirement and typescript as a pre, as both at the same time aren't possible and the job itself wants to move towards Angular (away from AngularJS), I've chosen to go with the typescript implementation.  
  
The assignment is a standard ["Code Kata" initially drafted by Uncle Bob](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata), as such, the problem itself has been explored a lot over the years and is generally considered a 'must learn' when getting into TDD (Test Driven Development).

## Demo

A demo is available through github pages at https://xonefobic.github.io/bowling-test.  
It is compiled with Angular 12.0.3
